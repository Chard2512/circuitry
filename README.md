# circuitry

circuitry is a library with tools for circuit creation and utilities for the roblox game [Circuit Maker 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/6652606416/Circuit-Maker-2). Forked from SKM GEEK's original project: https://github.com/QEStudios/cm2py.git.

## Installation

Download cm2 folder on src, copy it to your project directory and import it as below

```python
import cm2.circuitry as ck
```

But, for convenience, you can also import all stuff without having to write ck everytime. It's recommended for most projects centered on Circuit Maker 2.

```python
from cm2.circuitry import *
```
